## Amalgamated Source Code

The individual source files of my projects are too numerous to upload individually. (And I don't use special github apps.)

The files here are amalgamations created by my compiler. They can be compiled directly in that form, or with a simple tool can be extracted again (the directory at the start gives file size and offset within the file).

(Note the .ma extension apparently means something to github, so the text is highlighted in a funny way.)

#### Guide to Projects

**ax** x64 Assembler (designed for generated asm source code, and supported only a subset of x64)

**mx** M compiler (used to compile all .m source files, and .ma amalgamated/application files)

**qx** Q compiler/interpreter

**cx** C subset compiler
